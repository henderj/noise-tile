# noise-tile
a tileable sprite based on perlin noise.

Here is a gif of the tileable noise, tiled 4 times to make a 2x2 grid. As you can tell, it is seamless in 3 dimensions (x, y, time).

The jupyter file basically just puts the images in a grid and in a loop. The images are generated from a c++ file that I have yet to upload.
